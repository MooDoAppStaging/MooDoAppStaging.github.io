You can use the beta of the new version at <a href=\"https://beta.moo.do/w/\">https://beta.moo.do/w/</a> and download the new app at <a href=\"https://beta.moo.do/download/\">https://beta.moo.do/download/</a>. If you want to join the mobile beta, talk to Jay in the <a href=\"https://www.moo.do/beta/\">beta Slack</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:support@moo.do\">support</a>.</p>\n<p>The introduction has an “Import your data” page with an “Import from Moo.do” button which will copy your old account, data, and settings over.</p>\n<p>We suggest using the desktop app to reduce any possible chance of data loss because it backs up your data to local files every 10 minutes, and that makes us feel safer.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-major-changes\">The Major Changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"storage-and-sync\">Storage and sync</h2>\n<p>Documents are now stored and synced with Firebase instead of your Drive account. When you load the page it now only gets new changes since the last sync, so the initial sync on load will be much faster. In our testing, the connection seems much more stable than before. And there’s no longer a maximum document size.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-documents\">Multiple documents</h2>\n<p>Each pane can now contain its own document. The pane sidebar that was the overview is now doing double duty as a document selector. Click the <img class=\"mobile-icon\" src=\"/blog/img/icon-overview.png\" /> at the top left of a pane to choose the document for that pane, and click the outline icon on the document to open its overview.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dates\">Dates</h2>\n<p>Dates are now stored separately from the text so that we can add more date features without cluttering the text. You can add a date by pressing <span class=\"hotkey\"><span class=\"hotkeyPri\"></span> + Shift + D</span>. That opens a popup where you can select a date on a calendar or type the date in text. This new system will let us add more date features in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encryption\">Encryption</h2>\n<p>All items are encrypted client-side before sending them to the database, and you can add an additional layer of security by using your own encryption password. You will be prompted to (optionally) set a password during the introduction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plugin-authorization\">Plugin authorization</h2>\n<p>We totally rewrote the way we authenticate plugins which should fix any sync issues you might have seen before.</p>\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\">Known issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>When enabling plugins in the desktop apps, the popup window goes white and doesn’t close, but it did work. If you close the window and reload the app, the plugin will be enabled. This is caused by a bug in Electron which should be fixed in the next update: <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/15216\">https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/15216</a></li>\n<li>Some items on calendar are showing twice</li>\n<li>Notifications may not work yet</li>\n<li>Enabling plugins with multiple accounts causes reauthorize messages for each account, but after reauthorizing everything works</li>\n<li>Undo/redo may be slightly buggy</li>\n<li>Google may say the app is not verified when enabling plugins. We submitted for verification but it will take a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"still-to-do\">Still to do</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharing</li>\n<li>Email snooze</li>\n<li>Account premium and trial management (everyone has premium features for now)</li>\n<li>New mobile apps</li>\n<li>Allow other login methods besides Google</li>\n<li>Support opening local files on your computer</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.mobile-icon {\n    width: 24px;\n    height: 24px;\n    vertical-align: top;\n}\n</style>"}],"isSinglePost":true}}
