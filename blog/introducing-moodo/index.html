At the grocery store, notice how many shoppers are clutching their basket in one hand and phone in the other trying to find an email they sent themselves with their shopping list on it.</p><p>For as much as we talk about being in the new era of super-smart connected devices, the function of really organizing our life remains an unresolved challenge.<br>
While there are many different apps available, most focus on being one thing (a to-do list, a note taker, a shopping list).  </p><p>We value easy above all else and the thought of having to use multiple apps is exhausting.  This is one of the key reasons most people only regularly use a handful of apps.  If you are busy and stressed out you just want a solution that is effortless and gets the job done.  </p><p>Will you ever read those handwritten notes from the meeting?  Probably not, but at least you have a solution that works for you.  </p><p>Was there a better way to sync your document besides emailing it to yourself?  Of course, but the last thing you need is another app to have to use!</p><p>This isn’t news to most.  We live busy, stressful lives, and are forgetful.  There is no shortage of to-do list and calendar apps that seek to solve the problem.  Unfortunately, most are either big business apps that think of organization secondarily or are narrowly focused and underpowered (i.e. its killer feature is being able to choose your own background image).</p><p><strong>Moo.do</strong> is a brand new app that seeks to solve the broader challenge of organizing your life.  <strong>Moo.do</strong> wants to be more than just a to-do list or calendar or note taking system.  Integrating your favorite apps and services into a single organizational tool is our goal, because we believe no one company will offer a bundle that works for everyone.  </p><p><strong>Moo.do</strong> believes that the answer is not an ‘all or nothing’ ecosystem, but rather to create an ecosystem around your wants and preferences. Most people already have workable individual solutions for work, home and school.  What is needed is a glue to bind them together.  <strong>Moo.do</strong> initially solves this by bringing together a to-do list, planner, outliner and notepad that integrates with your Google Contacts and allows you to import and export data with other services.  Eventually many more partners will be added to fulfill the promise of your one solution for organizing your digital world.</p></div></div><div id="social"><span id="shareFB" class="fb-share-button" data-href="http://www.moo.do/blog/introducing-moodo" data-type="button"></span><a id="shareTwitter" href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-text="#MooDo Blog Post: " data-count="none">Tweet</a><span id="shareGoogle" class="g-plus" data-action="share" data-annotation="none"></span></div></div><div class="footerSpacer"></div><div id="footer"><div class="center"><a class="link h" href="/">About</a><a class="link h selected" href="/blog/">Blog</a><a class="link h" href="/us/">About Us</a><a class="link h" href="/press/">Press</a><a class="link h" href="/privacy/">Privacy</a><span class="socialIcons"><a class="link h" target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/MooDoApp"><i class="icon-facebook"></i></a><a class="link h" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/MooDoApp"><i class="icon-twitter"></i></a><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://google.com/+MooDoApp" ref="publisher"><i class="icon-google-plus"></i></a><a class="link" target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@moo.do"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a></span></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">
